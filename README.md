Simple counter application that I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. The counter allowed users to start counting up from a specified number, pause the counting, continue counting from where they left off, and reset the counter to its initial value.

To create this counter, I first designed the layout and styling of the application using HTML and CSS. I then used React to create the logic and functionality of the counter, including defining the initial value of the counter and implementing the start, pause, continue, and reset features.

Using JavaScript, I created event listeners that allowed users to interact with the counter by clicking on buttons that controlled the different functionalities.
